# 🤖 AI Agents for Capstone Project

This repository contains modular AI agents being developed as part of our Capstone Project. These agents are designed to operate autonomously or cooperatively to perform complex tasks such as data retrieval, decision-making, content generation, and user interaction. Eventually, these will be integrated into a comprehensive AI-powered system tailored to real-world problem-solving.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Our objective is to build intelligent agents that simulate human reasoning and task execution. These agents will form the backbone of our Capstone Project, which aims to [brief description of final project goal, e.g., “provide personalized agricultural solutions to farmers using real-time data inputs”].

Each agent is designed with a specific capability and can work alone or with others in a multi-agent system architecture.
